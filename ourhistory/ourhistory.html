            <h3>The great of the greats NIKE</h3>
            <p>It was founded on January 25, 1957 as "Blue Ribbons Sports" (BRS),89 by University of Oregon athlete Phil Knight and his coach, William Jay "Bill" Bowerman. The company began distributing Onitsuka Tiger (currently ASICS) footwear until 1971, when BRS launched its first own product, with the brand's emblem designed by Carolyn Davidson.

                According to Otis Davis, an athlete, whom Bowerman coached at the University of Oregon, who later went on to win two gold medals at the 1960 Rome Olympics. Bowerman made the first pair of Nike shoes for him, which contradicts the claim that they were made by Phil Knight.
                
                
                A Nike store in the Vaughan Mills shopping center in Ontario, Canada.
                In 1964, in its first year in business, BRS sold 1,300 pairs of running shoes for a total profit of $8,000. By 1965 the new company had acquired one full-time employee, and sales had reached $20,000. In 1966, BRS opened its first store located at 3456 Boulevard in Santa Monica, California, next to a beauty salon. In 1967, due to rapidly increasing sales, BRS expanded its retail and distribution operations on the East Coast to Wellesley, Massachusetts.
                
                In 1971, the relationship between BRS and Onitsuka Tiger was coming to an end. BRS is preparing to launch its own line of footwear, which would feature the newly designed Swoosh by Carolyn Davidson. The Swoosh was first used by Nike on June 18, 1971, and on January 22, 1974, it was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
                
                In 1976, the company hired Seattle-based John Brown and Partners as its first advertising agency. The following year, the agency created Nike's first "brand ad", called "There Is No Finish Line", in which no Nike products were shown. By 1980, Nike had achieved a 50% market share of the US athletic shoe market, and the company went public in December of that year.</p>
